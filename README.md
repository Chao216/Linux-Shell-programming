# Linux-Shell-programming

in Shell, you can create a varibale with `VARIABLE_NAME=value`

by convention, use uppercase for variable name, and no space betwwen `=`.

when you need to output an varaible, put `$` before variable name.

if you want to assign command output to an varibale, wrap command with $(command) or`\`command\``
